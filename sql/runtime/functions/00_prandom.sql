-- Doom's P_Random, as far as a set-based engine can have one.
--
-- m_random.c draws rndtable[++prndindex & 0xff]: one global table, walked in
-- whatever order the thinker list runs. There is no such order here -- every
-- monster on the map is one row of one statement, evaluated as a set -- so a
-- walking index cannot be reproduced, and anything recorded against it could
-- never be replayed. The table below is Doom's; the index into it is derived
-- instead, from (actor, tic, call site). That is reproducible by
-- construction: the same world, ticked again on the same input, draws the
-- same numbers however the rows happen to be evaluated.
--
-- p_use separates call sites, so two draws for one actor in one tic -- a
-- shot's spread and its damage roll, say -- are independent rather than equal.
--
-- The three multipliers are large odd 32-bit constants and the sum goes
-- through an xor-shift-multiply before a byte is taken out of the middle.
-- Small multipliers are not enough on their own: a tic counter times 40503
-- leaves the first tics below the bits being extracted, and tic 0 and tic 1
-- drew the same number. The final multiplier is deliberately 16-bit so the
-- product stays inside a signed 64-bit integer.
